  <h1>My 24-Hour Media Diary: Data, Privacy, and Algorithms</h1>
  <p><strong>Date Recorded:</strong> [New date]</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This media diary documents my media use over a 24-hour period with a specific focus
    on the data and information I generate while using digital platforms. In addition
    to tracking what media I consumed or created, I reflected on what personal,
    behavioral, and interest-based data may be collected, stored, or shared by these platforms.
  </p>

  <h2>24-Hour Media Log & Data Awareness</h2>

  <p><strong>Morning:</strong><br>
    I woke up this morning and recorded the calories I consumed for breakfast, which included 
    cinnamon pancakes, eggs, chorizo, and a smoothie made from multiple fruits. While eating, 
    I checked the news on my Ground News app, which showed me both local and nationwide headlines. 
    Safe to say, things haven’t really changed lately, and America is still facing many challenges, 
    but that’s neither here nor there. I tried to reduce Instagram and X usage, so I worked out 
    after letting my breakfast digest for about 45 minutes. I recorded my workout with the Notes 
    app from Google, which sometimes completes common phrases I use. I ended up forgetting my 
    intention to use less social media and checked Instagram Reels during breaks between sets. 
    I liked around ten posts, roughly estimating. While watching these reels, I noticed that most 
    of the content was recommended based on my previous likes, which made me realize how much data 
    Instagram collects from even small interactions. Everything I do could be influencing what I see next. 
    I also thought about how my exercise log in the Notes app might be analyzed by Google if it is synced 
    with other services (although it's not), even if I’m only using it for personal tracking.
    I wondered whether these small habits collectively create a profile of me that I’m not fully aware of. 
    

  </p>

  <p><strong>Afternoon:</strong><br>
    I would like to say that I read the terms of service, but I really don’t. I know when my phone is listening to me and recording data, 
    Because when I went on YouTube to search for instrumental packs for my music software, I started seeing ads for those same packs on Instagram. 
    It’s always a little eerie how apps owned by different companies exchange information without explicit permission. YouTube is owned by Google, 
    and Instagram is owned by Meta, so I’m not sure how this works technically. After that, I spent time on my computer playing Kenshi and watching videos. 
    I usually watch long-form videos to grow my recommendations, but short videos sometimes disrupt the algorithm, which then tries to balance my feed with medium-length content. 
    I expected this data to be recorded, and for the most part, I’m okay with it as long as no one is harmed. I spent most of the afternoon playing Kenshi and tracked what I ate in my nutrition app. 
    I also noticed that the types of videos I watched seemed to adjust what YouTube suggested next, even within the same genre. Thinking about this, 
    I realized that my viewing behavior is constantly being analyzed to predict what I might click next, and I’m providing behavioral data almost without thinking about it. 
  
  </p>

  <p><strong>Evening:</strong><br>
    Throughout the day, I message friends and family, but I make it a point to do so while dinner is cooking. I cooked for my family, smoking chicken wings (highly recommended), while texting friends on Instagram and family on SMS. 
    Google Messages appears to respect privacy, but Meta is blatant about data usage. For example, I texted a friend about an upcoming concert, and shortly after, I saw not one, not two, but three ads for the concert in March. 
    This shows that they read my messages and inferred interests, even though I rarely listen to this artist. At least I know it’s not from Spotify.
    This made me think about how much information I’m unknowingly sharing with platforms. Even casual conversations about hobbies or events can be converted into data points that target me for marketing purposes. It’s surprising how quickly the algorithm seems to react to small interactions, which makes me more conscious of my digital footprint during these seemingly ordinary activities. 

  </p>

  <p><strong>Late Night:</strong><br>
    I usually sleep at this time, so if my phone is tracking me, it would primarily record my location and sleeping patterns. 
    I never considered how wearable devices or phone sensors might track movement, heart rate, or even subtle behaviors while I sleep, contributing more data to platforms or fitness apps without my direct interaction. 
    Even though I am mostly unaware during this time, the collection of passive data seems almost constant. Maybe turning off the phone is a good idea...
  </p>

  <h2>Privacy, Security, and Algorithmic Influence</h2>
  <p>
    Do I know what I agreed to share? I assume I agreed to share everything about myself because 
    I don’t read the terms of service. They are intentionally long, hiding some of the actions 
    that could be viewed negatively. <br><br>
    How could this data be used? Platforms and data brokers can use it to target advertising or 
    sell it to other companies. Essentially, my data helps fuel algorithms for advertising, and 
    potentially, for other purposes. My personal theory is that it’s also used for shaping opinions, 
    though that may sound like a tinfoil-hat idea. <br><br>
    Did I notice promoted or algorithm-driven content? Yes. I noticed a significant amount of 
    promoted material, and I am aware that some content is shadow-banned, which is concerning. 
    This shows how much platforms control what I see and interact with.
  </p>

  <h2>Reflection & Reconsideration</h2>
  <p>
    Overall, I feel that it doesn’t matter much whether I change my behavior or not; the world 
    keeps going, and not using these platforms could put me at a disadvantage. Many jobs and 
    social expectations assume people use social media, so opting out can create social and 
    professional limitations. <br><br>
    Tracking my meals and nutrition manually would take far more time without apps that inevitably 
    collect data, so in a way, using these tools is almost necessary for efficiency. Socially, not 
    having these platforms creates gaps in communication and participation. <br><br>
    Despite these concerns, I noticed patterns in my media use that help me structure my day. Being 
    aware of these patterns makes me more deliberate in balancing productivity, entertainment, 
    and data awareness.
