  <h1>My 24-Hour Media Diary</h1>

  <p><strong>Date Recorded:</strong> January 17, 2026</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This post documents my media usage over a 24-hour period. Media includes all forms of
    information and entertainment consumption such as social media, streaming services,
    messaging apps, news platforms, music, video games, and search engines.
  </p>

  <h2>Media Use Log</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Morning:</strong>
      I spent my morning eating eggs on toast while scrolling through the Ground News app,
      which I usually do while eating. After getting bored, I switched to Instagram and
      watched a few reels. I then worked out to maintain my physical health. Since it was
      my day off, I finished the morning by playing some video games.

      <strong>Afternoon:</strong>
      During the afternoon, I checked to see if I had any assignments due and was relieved
      to find that I did not. After that, I spent time drawing and working on my visual novel,
      which involved brainstorming ideas and planning out story structure.
    </li>

      <strong>Evening:</strong>
      After getting tired, I decided to take a nap and ended up sleeping through most of
      the evening.
    </li>

      <strong>Late Night:</strong>
      Feeling refreshed after my nap, I worked on composing music for my visual novel.
      Later, I continued playing the video game <em>Kenshi</em>, which I am currently very
      invested in. Overall, it was a productive and enjoyable day.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What I Discovered</h2>
  <p>
    I realized that I spend a significant amount of time playing video games on my days off.
    While this helps me relax and avoid burnout, I could likely complete my visual novel
    faster if I focused more consistently on it. School remains my top priority, but outside
    of that, I noticed that I have a lot of screen time. In the future, I may try to incorporate
    more outdoor activities that are not exercise-related into my routine.
  </p>

  <h2>Most Credible Media Sources</h2>
  <p>
    With the rise of media outlets pushing specific agendas, I sometimes worry that my view
    of the world is being shaped more by corporations than by objective information.
    My primary news source is Ground News. While it may sound like an advertisement, I value
    it because it clearly shows political bias, source leanings, and language patterns across
    different outlets. This transparency helps reduce my anxiety about misinformation and
    allows me to make more informed judgments about current events.
